After installing a bunch of packages in jspm, for example after doing a big [migration from bower](https://github.com/Munter/bower-to-jspm), it takes a long time to manually check if each package is correctly configured in your systemjs config file.

This tool automates the testing of whether each of your installed modules loads without error.

Usage
-----

```
npm install -g jspm-config-test
cd path/to/your/project
jspm-config-test
```

This will read your `package.json` and find the relevant information to test your jspm configuration.

The output will look something like this:

```
